# rclone-installer

this is an small script i created to download and install the latest rclone version from Nick's release page. just incase you dont want to install go on an system or just need an quick way to automate setting up rclone. feel free to make changes for your own system if you need to.  all you need to do is download the rclone-dl.sh to your local machine and run it. also just make sure you have wget, curl and unzip as well since the script uses that to setup rclone.
